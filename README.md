# Deadshot
A spiritual successor to NetCut by Arcai. Focuses on a single target as of this version. Works primarily on Debian-based distros, but could be slightly edited to work with others.

To use, enter the listening network interface, the host IPv4 address, and the ARP table host (usually the router in a LAN). 

Happy shooting!
